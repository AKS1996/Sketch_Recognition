This is the Repo of our Quick Draw Kaggel Competition Project.<br>
We present our data preprocessing, models fittings, and a finding fun application of the Google Quick, Draw! dataset. This project was built by Akhilesh Reddy, Vincent Kuo, Kirti Pande, Tiffany Sung, and Helena Shi. To see the full walk-through, find our blog post at: __blog__

Walk with us through this journey to see how we have tackled the challenge in successfully classifying what is “arguably the world’s cutest research dataset!”
