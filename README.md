# Doodling with Deep Learning!

### This is the Repo of our Quick Draw Kaggel Competition Project.<br>
### We present our data preprocessing, models fittings, and a fun application of the Google Quick, Draw! dataset. This project  was built by Akhilesh Reddy, Vincent Kuo, Kirti Pande, Tiffany Sung, and Helena Shi. To see the full walk-through, find our blog post at: __blog__

#### Walk with us through this journey to see how we have tackled the challenge in successfully classifying what is “arguably the world’s cutest research dataset!”    

<br>
<br>
**Shuffle_CSV_and_ResNet** folder:  includes data pre-processing/shuffle csv code and the ResNet model we tried.<br>
**Mobile_net** folder:  includes the LSTM and Mobile Net model code.<br>
**OtherModels** folder: we tried some skicit learn classifiers for instance Random Forest, k-NN and MLP Classifier.<br>
**QuickDraw** folder: One can replicate the application we created by running the QuickDrawApp.py code. Also, download the CNN model from the following link: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1PAFXI5HrY7HguZy0I8yDaUQUebTQYus0 and save in the same location as the folder.The model is trained for 15 classes:
Donut 🍩;Eye 👁;Tent ⛺; Bicycle 🚲; Flower 🌸; Mermaid 🧜‍; Snake 🐍; Camera 📷; Pineapple 🍍; Rainbow 🌈; Lipstick 💄; Face 😊; Shoe 👠; Cup ☕; Hockey stick 🏑

A preview of the application is as follows:
